# Instagram-ghost-unfollower
A bot that gathers the users Instagram followers and followees and unfollows those who don't follow the user back.

Keep in mind, Instagram servers may ignore some unfollow requests if there are too many. If this happens, some of the ghosts (people who don't follow the user back) may not have been unfollowed. No worries! Just run the bot again until all ghosts have been busted, or if the user wants to manually do some busting.
